This is my rendition of the classic arcade game: Pong. I have implemented a visually pleasing
GUI in lilac with white accents. The primary functions of this game are very simple. The user
will utilize the mouse for all controls. The user will click to serve the ball and move their
paddle by moving the mouse cursor up and down.

## Part 2: New

> What is something new and/or exciting that you learned from working
> on this project?

I learned how to make something that is interactive utilizing JavaFX. Before, we had done
search querys but this final project allowed me to implement an actual game that people
play. I was excited to learn about how the different javafx components conglomerate
to make something that is tangible for a user.

## Part 3: Retrospect

> If you could start the project over from scratch, what do
> you think might do differently and why?

If I could start over, I would definitely ensure that I have a linear progression on
implementing Pong. I started sort-of on track with creating the paddles, ball, and the GUI.
But eventually, I kept skipping around and implementing different mechanisms such as making
the scoreboard first instead of figuring out how to make the ball move. Then I increased the
ball's speed before figuring out how to keep it within the bounds of the GUI.
